Pathogen can survive outside the body in fresh, warm water. Increase infectivity, especcially in humid environments and ship transmission
Gives pathogen ability to travel on dust particles. Increase infectivity, especcially in arid enviroments and plane transmission
Insects susceptible to infection. Carrier insects increase infectivity, especcially in hot climates and chance of mutation
Gives organism ability to spread through blood-to blood contact. Increase infectivity, especcially in poor regions
Livestock susceptible to infection. Increase infectivity, especcially in rural regions
