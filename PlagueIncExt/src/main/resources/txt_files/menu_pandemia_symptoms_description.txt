Irritated stomach lining leads to discomfort. Slight chance of infection when kissing
Chance of infection by spreading pathogen into surroundings, especcially in high density, urban areas
The skin becomes blistered and painful, sightly increasing infectivity
Serious fluid build and discharge from the lungs. People in cold climates especcialy vulnerable
Pathogens attach to lymphocytes, suppressing immunr system. 
The loss of fluid through sweating alse increases infection rates due to poor hygiene. More dangerous in cold countries
Catastrophic cell death of multiple tissue types causes body-wide organ failure and rapid death
Neuropathic effects in the brain stem cause loss of consciousness and sometimes death. Significantly harder to cure
Severe loss of blood volume causes oxygen deprivation, loss of consciousness and death
Random blackouts and fits reduce the patient's ability to function independently. Can be fatal
Irrational delusions and mental symptoms. Victims distrust of others makes them unlikely to seek treatment or cooperate with others
Pathogen disrupts cell growth pathways, causing uncontrolled, eventually fatal tumour growth
Inability to sleep makes people irritable and less productive
Painful lumps containing pockets of the pathogen. Slight chance of bursting which can spread disease
Decrease in red blood cells or haemoglobin in the blood can lead to hypoxia in the organs
