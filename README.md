Server by Daria Dunina  
Simulation and Client by Karina Balagazova  
The main goal of the semester project was to create a working game engine and simulation, therefore, we made more emphasis on the work between the server and the client, and omitted some details (such as design, names, etc.), so the application requires minor improvements.
